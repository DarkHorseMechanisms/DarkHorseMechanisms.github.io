      <description>In my previous post I guided you through how to use Hugo to make a site to deploy on GitHub. In this post I will show you how to go deeper with your customisations, and what you need to do to get the results you want.
First you need to make a Hugo site to play with, and have Git and GitHub pages set up. This was all touched on in my previous techblog post.</description>

      <title>Hugo and this Site</title>

      <description>I built this site using the Static Site Generator Hugo, and the Hermit theme by Track3.
Why a Static Site? Static sites load once when accessed. This makes them cheap to serve. Services like Netifly and GitHub pages will serve your website for free. Additionally, because they lack dynamic elements (basically the &amp;lsquo;moving parts&amp;rsquo; of a modern website), they don&amp;rsquo;t need updating for security reasons or otherwise. I can &amp;ldquo;fire-and-forget&amp;rdquo; with this setup.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m recording this link library for myself but others may find it useful.
Most resources are free. Recommendations within sites can be found on the profiles. Some links are duplicated in sections for my own workflow.
Hard links to the subsections are in this post, the list below this post shows the most recent additions.

      <description>I built this website to store, organise and share all my work for the DarkHorseMechanisms project. This is a creative project meant to house all of my output for professional and personal development. Some of it may not make sense to you, or it may offend you, or you may wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m doing some or any of it. Nevertheless it is here and you may read it. Some of it is art and I will try to make the distinction clear; when I&amp;rsquo;m talking about facts or my beliefs, or offering guidance, I am speaking sincerely and sometimes with great urgency.</description>
