      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m recording this link library for myself but others may find it useful.
Most resources are free. Recommendations within sites can be found on the profiles. Some links are duplicated in sections for my own workflow.

      <description>I built this website to store, organise and share all my work for the DarkHorseMechanisms project. This is a creative project meant to house all of my output for professional and personal development. Some of it may not make sense to you, or it may offend you, or you may wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m doing some or any of it. Nevertheless it is here and you may read it. Some of it is art and I will try to make the distinction clear; when I&amp;rsquo;m talking about facts or my beliefs, or offering guidance, I am speaking sincerely and sometimes with great urgency.</description>
