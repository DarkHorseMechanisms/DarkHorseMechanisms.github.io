      <description>I built this site using the Static Site Generator Hugo, and the Hermit theme by Track3.
Why a Static Site? Static sites load once when accessed. This makes them cheap to serve. Services like Netifly and GitHub pages will serve your website for free. Additionally, because they lack dynamic elements (basically the &amp;lsquo;moving parts&amp;rsquo; of a modern website), they don&amp;rsquo;t need updating for security reasons or otherwise. I can &amp;ldquo;fire-and-forget&amp;rdquo; with this setup.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m recording this link library for myself but others may find it useful.
Most resources are free. Recommendations within sites can be found on the profiles. Some links are duplicated in sections for my own workflow.
Hard links to the subsections are in this post, the list below this post shows the most recent additions.

      <description>I built this website to store, organise and share all the work associated with the DarkHorseMechanisms project. This is a personal project with both fixed goals and creative freedom. It is part of my journey into programming.
I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it relatively anonymous to preserve my ability to speak and create freely. I reserve my right to be wrong or otherwise offensive at any time.
This website contains a useful link library - selections from my own bookmarks stored here for my use and yours.</description>
