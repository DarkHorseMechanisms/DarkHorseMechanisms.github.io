			<description>I&amp;rsquo;m recording this link library for myself but others may find it useful.
Most resources are free. Recommendations within sites can be found on the profiles. Some links are duplicated in sections for my own workflow.
Hard links to the subsections are in this post, the list below this post shows the most recent additions.

			<description>I built this website to store, organise and share all my work for the DarkHorseMechanisms project. This is a creative project meant to house all of my output for professional and personal development. Some of it may not make sense to you, or it may offend you, or you may wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m doing some or any of it. Nevertheless it is here and you may read it. Some of it is art and I will try to make the distinction clear; when I&amp;rsquo;m talking about facts or my beliefs, or offering guidance, I am speaking sincerely and sometimes with great urgency.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I built this website to store, organise and share all my work for the DarkHorseMechanisms project. This is a creative project meant to house all of my output for professional and personal development. Some of it may not make sense to you, or it may offend you, or you may wonder why I&rsquo;m doing some or any of it. Nevertheless it is here and you may read it. Some of it is art and I will try to make the distinction clear; when I&rsquo;m talking about facts or my beliefs, or offering guidance, I am speaking sincerely and sometimes with great urgency. Sometimes I will be trying to leave a legacy of truth for my children. It is inevitable that I will often be wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kept it relatively anonymous to preserve my ability to speak and create freely without judgement in my personal life and future career. I do welcome discourse.</p>
<p>This website contains a useful <a href="/links">link library</a> - selections from my own bookmarks stored here for my use and yours. Almost all of the resources and links are free or contain free content.</p>
<p>This site was made using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/">hermit theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Track3/hermit">Track3</a>(<a href="https://github.com/Track3/hermit/blob/master/LICENSE">License</a>).</p>
<p>You can read about how I did it, why I&rsquo;m using Hugo, and why I&rsquo;m using static site generation with GitHub Pages <a href="posts/writing/techblog/hugo">here</a>. Or click <a href="/posts">here</a> to see a list of recent posts.</p>
