			<description>This is a website built to store, organise and share all the work associated with the DarkHorseMechanisms project. As well as my own work, it contains a useful link library - selections from my own bookmarks stored here for my use and yours. Almost all of the resources and links are free or contain free content.
This site was made using Hugo, a static (load-once) website generator. It is hosted on GitHub pages.</description>
